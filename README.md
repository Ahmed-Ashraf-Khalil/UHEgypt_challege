Quantify the diï¬€erences between two distance measurement sources *(a source device (with errors and missing data) and a benchmark device (that takes much more accurate readinds we'd like to match))* with real life dataset that are used for a run tracking app work is to build a model that can minimize the gaps between distance values across the track to achieve a similar total track distance from both sources. The model will learn the distance calculation mechanism from the benchmark source to be able to correct distance values from the other source.
